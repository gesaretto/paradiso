	- Incredible book.

> Thus, I will try to reconnect the advent of perspective to its roots in the intense religious and moral preoccupations of the European late Middle Ages, to the "period eye" of the Reinassance in Michael Baxandall's famous phrase. Whatever one may say about the eventual use or misuse of geometric perspective as a tool of Western political power, it was surely conceived in the early fifteenth century as a very medieval Christian solution to a very medieval Christian problem. It must be understood in the context of the strongly held spiritual beliefs and assumptions of the still devout Christians who longed for painted and sculpted images that could arouse the feeling of divine presence and reinforce their faith that God and his saints were still immanent in their daily lives.

> [_Alberti's_] most original contribution, however, has ever since become known as "Alberti's window" (ill. 5), to be described and discussed in later pages. Its importance, in essence (even if originally unintended), is that it subtly shifted the object of perspective painting away from "mirroring" Nature as if it were a mere reflection of God's true briliance in heaven, to seeing Nature instead as if through an open window, not as divine mystery revealed by geometry, but as worldly perfection framed by geometry.

	- Crucial. A lot could and should be said about this passage; it has to be understood that Dante is at the same time suggesting a _transumanare_, a rhetorical exploration of the invisible, and the very opposite - a system that is based on the direct observation of the skies and their functioning. Dante is looking at the ways in which light and stars work - his eyes can go as far as they can; there is no limit to human observation yet, and to what science can accomplish when it follows theology. These scientific phoenomena are used by Dante as the fragments of the invisible; they are used to construct the invisible.
